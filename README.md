# homework
## week 4
Choose an entity that you would like to act as a representative for throughout the remainder of the course. It can be an individual, a community, a non-human entity or a cyborg.
Identify a specific need or value of that entity.
#### Data Assignment
1) Search for, conceptualize, or create a dataset(s) related to the entity you chose.
- Aim for data that could be used to promote/protect the need or value that you identified.
- Consider any relationships that data could create or mediate.
2) Create a folder with [YOUR_NAME]_[ENTITY_NAME] (e.g., alex_binturong) in this repository.
- create a "data" folder and upload whatever your data from 1)
- create a README.md file to keep any notes.
- EXAMPLE: https://github.com/arputtick/data_cyborgs/tree/main/alex_binturong
