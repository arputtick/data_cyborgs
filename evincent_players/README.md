# Being Our Best Players

## Notes

I am aiming for my data focus to be on the gaming community (with a particular focus on the indie-sphere, though that is still a fairly nebulous community).

In thinking of where to start with my naming conventions, an interesting feeling that came about is that it can be a lot more cringe to call oneself a 'gamer' in the present day. If there was a golden age of gaming I think I missed it by a few years but I definitely hit upon a solid 'silver age', so my natural instinct is to identify with the term 'gamer' quite heavily. In naming my folder I wasn't sure there was any solid synonym, and I questioned the need to even change the term, but I have eventually settled on 'players' as I think the shift in focus onto the active verb is an interesting one.
